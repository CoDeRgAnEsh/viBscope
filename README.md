DEVELOPMENT OF IoT BASED VIBRATION MONITORING AND SPECTRUM ANALYSIS SYSTEMS FOR TECHNICAL OBJECTS

//Done as a course project MEC320T - Sensors & Control

# Objective

* To design a low cost alternative to vibration monitor and spectrum  analyzer using the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and 3-axis digital MEMS ADXL345 accelerometer.
* To study if inexpensive vibration monitoring systems could be suitable for condition monitoring
* To highlight  the  impact  of  different components  of  the  signal  chain  to  the  measured  vibration  signal  itself  and  familiarize the reader with the signal chain found in vibration monitoring. 
* To analyze vibration parameters in order to predict and prevent possible accidents, thus reducing the costs associated with the failure of the cutting tools, expensive parts and assemblies of the CNC machine
